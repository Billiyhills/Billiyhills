In the tapestry of life, each thread tells a tale,\
Of dreams woven with hope, through trials we sail.\
With every stumble, we learn to rise,\
Painting our journey beneath endless skies.\
Like a river carving its path through stone,\
Resilience flows in every heart and bone.\
Though storms may gather and shadows may fall,\
Stand tall, for within you lies the strength of it all.\
Embrace the journey, for itâ€™s yours to create,\
A symphony of courage, where dreams resonate.
